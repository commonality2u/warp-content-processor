# Pytest Timeout Failure Analysis - Task Completion Summary

## What We Accomplished

This demonstrates **Step 7: Capture and analyze timeout failures** by showing how to:

1. **Capture timeout failures** with detailed stack traces
2. **Analyze different types** of hanging operations
3. **Use log files** for deeper investigation
4. **Automate the analysis** process

## Key Demonstrations

### 1. Basic Timeout Capture

```bash
# Run test with timeout and capture logs
pytest test_file.py --timeout=30 --timeout-method=thread --log-file=debug.log --log-level=DEBUG -v -s
```

### 2. Types of Timeout Failures Analyzed

#### Simple Sleep Timeout

- **Stack trace shows**: `time.sleep(10)` at line 13
- **Easy to identify**: Clear sleep statement in trace
- **Fix**: Remove or reduce sleep duration

#### Infinite Loop Timeout

- **Stack trace shows**: Last executed line in loop (print statement)
- **Characteristics**: Shows counter/processing statements within loop
- **Fix**: Add proper exit conditions and maximum iteration limits

#### Thread Deadlock Timeout

- **Stack trace shows**: Multiple threads waiting on locks
  - Thread-2: `with lock2:` at line 53
  - Thread-3: `with lock1:` at line 61
  - MainThread: `thread1.join()` at line 71
- **Pattern**: Classic deadlock - each thread holds one lock and wants the other
- **Fix**: Establish lock ordering, use timeouts on joins

### 3. Stack Trace Analysis Patterns

#### Key Information in Timeout Traces:

- **Thread information**: Names, IDs, and current state
- **Exact line numbers**: Where each thread was when timeout occurred
- **Call stack**: Complete execution path leading to hang
- **Code context**: The actual line that was executing

#### Analysis Workflow:

1. **Identify timeout type** from stack trace patterns
2. **Locate hanging operation** using line numbers
3. **Check logs** for context leading to hang
4. **Examine code** around identified lines
5. **Look for missing timeouts** in network/IO operations
6. **Check resource cleanup** (connections, files, locks)

### 4. Automated Analysis Tool

Created `analyze_timeout.py` that:

- **Runs tests** with timeout automatically
- **Parses stack traces** to identify hanging operations
- **Categorizes timeout types** (sleep, loop, deadlock, I/O, etc.)
- **Provides specific recommendations** for each type
- **Generates detailed reports** with actionable insights

Example usage:

```bash
python analyze_timeout.py test_timeout_demo.py::TestTimeoutScenarios::test_thread_deadlock_timeout --timeout=3 --output=analysis.md
```

### 5. Log File Analysis

While our simple tests didn't generate extensive logs, the framework supports:

- **DEBUG level logging** to capture detailed execution flow
- **Log file output** with `--log-file=debug.log`
- **Context analysis** showing what led up to the timeout
- **Resource tracking** for database connections, network calls, etc.

## Common Timeout Scenarios Covered

| Type              | Stack Trace Indicator | Common Causes                | Recommendations              |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Simple Sleep**  | `time.sleep()`        | Explicit sleeps              | Remove/reduce duration       |
| **Infinite Loop** | Loop statements       | Missing exit conditions      | Add max iterations           |
| **Deadlock**      | Multiple `with lock:` | Lock ordering issues         | Use consistent lock ordering |
| **I/O Blocking**  | `socket.connect()`    | No timeouts on network calls | Add explicit timeouts        |
| **Database Hang** | `.execute()` calls    | Long queries/transactions    | Add query timeouts           |

## Files Created

1. **`test_timeout_demo.py`** - Demonstrates different timeout scenarios
2. **`timeout_analysis_guide.md`** - Comprehensive analysis guide
3. **`analyze_timeout.py`** - Automated analysis tool
4. **`deadlock_analysis.md`** - Example analysis report
5. **`timeout_analysis_summary.md`** - This summary

## Real-World Application

This approach helps developers:

- **Quickly identify** the cause of hanging tests
- **Understand complex** multi-threaded issues
- **Fix timeout problems** with specific, actionable recommendations
- **Prevent future timeouts** by following best practices
- **Automate analysis** instead of manual stack trace reading

The combination of pytest-timeout's detailed stack traces, log file analysis, and automated parsing provides a complete toolkit for diagnosing and fixing hanging test operations.
